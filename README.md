Eclipse is an iOS jailbreak 'tweak' designed to implement customizable settings on your iOS device that allow the user to personalize their system's interface, including dark mode (before Apple implemented it in iOS 13, 6 years after this), but the possibilities are unlimited in terms of color choices, thanks to it's pre-set color choices and third party color wheel libraries.
