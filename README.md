# EclipseX - A Complete Nightmode (and more) for iOS 11
After finding it difficult to keep track of bug reports and issues for EclipseX, I've decided to turn this repository into a bug reporting platform for myself. In addition, information regarding EclipseX developer API's will be posted here, to aid developers in developing extensions for EclipseX, as well as tweaks compatible with it.

Below are specific instructions on reporting bugs, as well as API information.

## Reporting Bugs

* Before reporting a bug, *PLEASE* use the search bar to see if your issue is already present. Duplicate issues will be removed.

* Title your issue adequately. 

* Provide an accurate description of your issue in the description box. Be as descriptive as possible.

## Developer API Information

* This section is coming soon.
